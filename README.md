Contains a set of functions I use all the time when using R

When conducting analyses using R there are functions I use all the time for plotting, within apply functions, and others. To simplify their use I have put  together this small package, which I can call whenever I use one of my other packages.
Version 0.1.0 contsains no errors, no warnings, and no notes.
