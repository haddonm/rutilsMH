\description{
gettime is a function designed to facilitate the measurement
    of time between intervals within R software that are expected to
    take a maximum of hours. It calculates the time as seconds elapsed 
    from the start of each day. As long as the timing of events does not
    pass from one day to the next accurate results will be generated.

  begin <- gettime()
  for (i in 1:1e6) sqrt(i)
  finish <- gettime()
  print(finish - begin)
