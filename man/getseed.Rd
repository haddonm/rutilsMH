\usage{
getseed()
}
\value{
an integer up to 7 digits long
}
\description{
getseed generates a seed for use within set.seed. 
    It produces up to a 6 digit integer from the Sys.time. This
    Initially, at the start of a session there is no seed; a new one 
    is created from the current time and the process ID when one is 
    first required. Here, in getseed, we do not use the process ID so 
    the process is not identical but this at least allows the 
    set.seed value to be stored should the need to repeat a set of 
    simulations arise. The process generates up to a six digit number
    it then randomly reorders those digits and that becomes the seed.
    That way, if you were to call getseed in quick succession the
    seeds generated should differ even when they are generated close
    together in time.
